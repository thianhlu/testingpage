Please check with your wireless service provider to determine what fees apply to your access to and use of the App, including your receipt of Push Messages from the Company.

You acknowledge and agree that these Terms are solely between you and the Company, not Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the App or content thereof. Your use of the App must comply with the App Store’s applicable terms of use. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any, for the App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by these Terms. You and the Company acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of yours or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims, (b) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

Beta Features are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms. You agree that once you use a Beta Feature, your content or data may be affected such that you may be unable to revert back to a prior non-beta version of the same or similar feature. Additionally, if such reversion is possible, you may not be able to return or restore data created within the Beta Feature back to the prior non-beta version. Beta Features may not operate properly or be fully functional. We have the right unilaterally to abandon development, maintenance, and operation of the Beta Features, at any time and without any obligation or liability to you. 

THE BETA FEATURES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS AND MAY CONTAIN ERRORS OR INACCURACIES THAT COULD CAUSE FAILURES, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA AND INFORMATION FROM ANY CONNECTED DEVICE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL USE OF ANY BETA FEATURE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

You may earn points within the App by engaging in defined behaviors, as listed in the [Autograph Points Guide](https://ag.fan/points). Points that are determined to be earned in violation of these Terms will be removed from your Account. The accumulation of points is subject to Company’s sole discretion and Company reserves the right to modify, limit, or terminate point-earning opportunities at any time without notice. Company may, at its sole discretion, change the number of points awarded for each activity and/or change the type of activities eligible to earn points. Points are non-transferable, have no monetary value, and cannot be purchased, sold or redeemed for cash. 

6. ## Autograph Offers.

You may claim an Offer through the App; however, to redeem an Offer, you may be directed to a Third Party Platform (defined below) to complete the transaction. You acknowledge that you will need to agree to the specific terms and conditions and the privacy policy of that Third Party Platform in order to redeem such Offer. You understand and agree that Third Party Platforms are not controlled by Company, and that Company is not responsible for the content, availability, or privacy practices of the Third Party Platform.

We do not claim any ownership of Your Content. However, in order to operate the Services, we must obtain from you certain license rights in Your Content so that actions we take in operating the Service are not considered legal violations. Accordingly, by using the Service and submitting Your Content, you grant us a license to access, use, host, cache, store, reproduce, transmit, display, publish, distribute, and modify (for technical purposes, _e.g._, making sure content is viewable on smartphones as well as computers and other devices) Your Content to (a) operate, provide, improve, troubleshoot, and debug our Services, including any machine learning or algorithms informing the Services; (b) protect the Services; (c) customize the Services; (d) develop or improve new products or features; (e) as directed by you; and (f) as otherwise set forth in our Privacy Policy, as applicable.

5. ## Notice of Infringement – DMCA Policy.

1. identification of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that is claimed to be infringed;
2. identification of the allegedly infringing material that is requested to be removed, including a description of where it is located on the Service;

5. a statement that the information above is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright (or other applicable intellectual property) owner or the authorized person to act on behalf of the copyright (or other applicable intellectual property) owner; and

Please note that you will be liable for damages if you materially misrepresent that content or an activity is not infringing the copyrights of others.**<sup> ****</sup>**

8. # **Third Party Services and Materials.** 

_We have friends and, like good friends do, they share. So here is where we make sure you know what they share belongs to them. And if you head on over to their sites, what you do on their sites is governed by them. Isn’t the saying something like, what happens on a third-party site, stays on a third-party site? No? That’s not the saying?_ 

1. ## Use of Third Party Materials in the Services. 

The Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or materials from third parties (“**Third Party Materials**”) or provide links to and/or frames of certain third party websites. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that the Company is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, availability, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or websites, including what may be available in webview within our App. We do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party services, Third Party Materials or third-party websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other websites are provided solely as a convenience to you. 

2. ## Purchases on Third Party Platforms. 

The Services contain or may direct you to Offers (_e.g_., merchandise, experiences) available for purchase or redemption only on a third-party site or sites that we may direct you to when you choose to claim an Offer (a “**Third Party Platform**”). For clarity, a Third Party Platform is not part of the App. When you click “Claim Offer” for a Product that is only available for purchase or redemption on a Third Party Platform, you will be redirected to a page on the Third Party Platform where you may complete your transaction (subject to the applicable rules), or to a staging area (_e.g_., a queue) before the transaction is available for completion. Your use of any Third Party Platform is subject to that site’s terms of use or terms of service, as applicable, and you must comply with applicable third party terms of use or terms of service when completing your purchase and for any subsequent engagement with the Product through the Third Party Platform. If you do not have an account with the Third Party Platform at the time you attempt a purchase, you may be required to establish a user account, with an approved payment method, to complete a purchase for the selected Product. 

9. # **Disclaimers, Limitations of Liability, Indemnification, and Assumption of Risks.**

   1. Disclaimers. 

_In this section, you acknowledge that, while we will try our best to have the Services work to the best of our ability, at times the Services may not work as expected or out and out break. You agree that we will not be liable for those instances._

Your access to and use of the Services are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, its parents, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, suppliers and licensors (the “**the Company Entities**”) and all operators of Third Party Platforms DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. The Company Entities make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (a) the completeness, accuracy, availability, quality, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services; (b) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services; (c) the operation or compatibility of the Services with any other application or any particular system or device, (d) whether such Services will be supported, hosted or accessible in the future; and (e) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure or error-free basis; and (e) the deletion of, or the failure to store or transmit, Your Content and other communications maintained by the Services. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Company Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein.

YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS COMPANY FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY COMPANY DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER COMPANY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

2. # Limitations of Liability. ****

_In this section, you agree to limit our liability to you resulting from certain types of damages and limiting the overall liability to $100 or the amount you paid us over the last six months._

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY ENTITIES BE LIABLE (A) FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES), HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER UNDER THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE ARISING IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) EVEN IF THE COMPANY ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, OR (B) FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM, DEMAND OR DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE DELIVERY, USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES. THE COMPANY ENTITIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES FINALLY AWARDED SHALL NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00), OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID THE COMPANY ENTITIES, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX (6) MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 

THE LIMITATION OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND IS MATERIAL TO COMPANY’S DECISION TO ENTER THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND YOU. THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THE CONTENT AVAILABLE WITHIN THE SERVICES, WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

3. # Indemnification & Release. 

_In this section, you agree that if you do something you are not supposed to do relating to the Services and we get sued as a result, you will defend us from such claims._

By entering into these Terms and accessing or using the Services, you agree that you shall release, defend, indemnify and hold the Company Entities harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs), actions, inquiries, or investigations of any kind arising out of or in connection with: (a) your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation; (b) your violation of any rights of any third party; (c) your misuse of the Services or any Third Party IP; or (d) your negligence or wilful misconduct. Company reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with Company in the defense of such matter.

In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Company, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or the Services. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides:

A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.

If you are not a California resident, you waive your rights under any statute or common law principle similar to Section 1542 that governs your rights in the jurisdiction of your residence.

4. # Force Majeure. 

_Stuff Happens. In this section, you agree that we are not responsible for any failures of the Service related to big events outside of our control, such as pandemics, war, floods, or dogs and cats living together!_

We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any of our obligations under these Terms or in operating the App, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from any events beyond Company’s ability to control, including acts of God; flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics, pandemics, tsunami, explosion, war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, government order, law, or action, embargoes or blockades, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, shortage of adequate or suitable Internet connectivity, blockchain failures, telecommunication breakdown or shortage of adequate power or electricity, and other similar events beyond our control.

10. # **Arbitration And Class Action Waiver.**

_Please read this section carefully. Actually, read all of these sections carefully but this one most of all. It concerns your ability to bring a legal action against us. In this section, you agree to limit disputes to private arbitration instead of a public court. However, there is a process for opting out of the private arbitration at the beginning of your relationship with us, and circumstances where you could bring a claim in small claims court._

1. ## Informal Process First. 

If a dispute arises between you and Company, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. This requires first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if any, to the following email address: support\@ag.fan. For any dispute that Company initiates, we will send our written description of the dispute to the email address associated with your Account. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; and the specific relief sought. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the dispute and either party wishes to continue to pursue a resolution of the dispute, you and Company will proceed with the further formal dispute resolution provisions below.

The above process for an informal dispute resolution process is required before you may commence any formal dispute resolution proceeding. 

2. ## Arbitration Agreement. 

You and Company agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements (collectively, “**Claim**”) that may arise out of your access or use of the Services including without limitation (a) Company’s services and/or products, including the Services; (b) these Terms (including its formation, performance, and breach); or (c) that in any way relate to the provision or use of the Services, your relationship with Company, or any other dispute with Company, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 10 (collectively, the “**Arbitration Agreement**”). This includes Claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth in Section 10.8. You and the Company agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards (together, the “**JAMS Rules**”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to support\@ag.fan. If Company is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your Account or the email that Company has on file for you. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. You have a right to have the arbitration conducted via telephone or videoconference, or as an in-person hearing in your hometown area (if you live in the United States) or another location that is reasonably convenient to you. If you do not reside in the United States, any in-person arbitration proceedings shall be conducted only in Los Angeles County, California, United States, unless you and Company otherwise agree or the Arbitrator determines that such venue would be unreasonably burdensome to any party, in which case the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select another venue.

This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“**FAA**”) in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and Company expressly agree that the FAA shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply.

Except as set forth in this Section 10, the arbitrator or arbitration body, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part thereof are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). Except as limited by these Terms, the arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.

**THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE CLAIM, AND THAT RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.**

Except as set forth in Section 10.4 below, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions thereof remain in full force and effect.

3. ## Alternatives to Arbitration.

Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, each party retains the right to (a) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose; (b) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights); and (c) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party's claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party's right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.

4. ## **Waiver of Class Actions and Class Arbitrations.** 

**YOU AND COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT OTHERWISE IN THIS SECTION 10.4, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR OTHER CONSOLIDATED ACTION AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM, UNLESS COMPANY PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.**

**If there is a final judicial determination that this Section 10.4 is not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. This provision does not prevent you or Company from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.**

5. ## Batch Filings.

To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of disputes between you and the Company, the parties agree to treat 25 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts and/or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted against Company as a “**Batch Filing**.”

In the event of a Batch Filing, the filing party shall submit to JAMS and all other parties, a complete listing (“**The List**”) of all cases filed which shall include cases 1-25 as well any additional filings beyond the initial 25 filings, including updating The List as more filings occur. The List shall include the caption of the case and any previously assigned case number. The first 25 cases filed shall hereinafter be referred to as the “**Initial Filing**.” If your Claim is a part of a Batch Filing, the filing fees for the matter will be borne by you. If Company has already paid the filing fees, you will reimburse Company for those amounts before the matters can proceed further. Additionally, Company will have the option to serve its response to any demand that is part of a Batch Filing in a consolidated filing and/or serve consolidated discovery requests and/or responses.

A Batch Filing does not change the individual nature of the Claim and each Claim will be assigned its own arbitrator in accordance with JAMS rules unless the parties agree otherwise. In the event JAMS requires additional staffing to address the Batch Filing, the cost of the additional staff will be borne equally between all parties.

The parties agree that this provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Batch Filing. 

6. ## Arbitrator’s Decision.

The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable rules and procedures. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and these Terms. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitations of Liability" section of these Terms as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. 

You and Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and in connection with any such proceeding, further agree to accept service of process by U.S. mail and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.

7. ## Fees.

If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay any filing and hearing fees in excess of $250 that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the Arbitrator’s Rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. 

Each party is responsible for its own attorneys’ fees, expenses and costs unless otherwise set forth in these Terms. 

8. ## **Opt-Out.** 

**You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and waiver of class provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to support\@ag.fan or to the U.S. mailing address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section of these Terms. The notice must be sent to the Company within thirty (30) days of your registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms (or if this Section 10, pertaining to arbitration, is materially amended hereafter, within 30 days of such amendment being effective), otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms, and the notice must specify your name and mailing address. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the Company also will not be bound by them.**

11. # **Venue and Governing Law.**

_Any disputes we have that aren’t subject to arbitration or small claims court must be resolved in Los Angeles, and California law applies._

For any dispute not subject to arbitration or under the jurisdiction of a small claims court, you and Company agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of any venue in the federal and state courts located in Los Angeles County, California. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.

The Terms and the relationship between you and Company shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law provisions.

12. # **Duration and Termination of Terms.**

_How long our relationship lasts and how we break up (sniff)._

The agreement between you and Company reflected by these Terms is effective when you access the Services (for example, create an Account) and remains in effect until either you or we terminate the agreement in accordance with these Terms.

You may terminate your Account by accessing the “settings” page in the App and clicking on “Delete Account” at the bottom of the screen. Terminations typically will be effective within twenty-four (24) hours, at which time your Account will be closed and you will no longer enjoy access to your former Account.

At any time, with or without notice, for any or no reason, Company reserves the right to modify or discontinue any portion or all of the Services, and to restrict, suspend, and terminate any user’s Account. 

All provisions which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement by the Company or you. Termination will not limit any of the Company’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity. 

13. # **Additional Provisions.**

    1. ## SMS Messaging and Phone Calls. 

_In this section, you agree to let us text or call you. You can opt out of text messages._ 

Certain portions of the Services may allow us to contact you via telephone or text messages, such as for two factor authentication. You agree that the Company may contact you via telephone or text messages (including by an automatic telephone dialing system) at any of the phone numbers provided by you or on your behalf in connection with your use of the Services, including for marketing purposes. You understand that you are not required to provide this consent as a condition of using the Services. You also understand that you may opt out of receiving promotional text messages from us at any time, either by texting the word “STOP” to the number that sent you the most recent promotional text message using the mobile device that is receiving the messages, or by contacting support\@ag.fan.

2. ## Entire Agreement.

_These Terms and other rules we post on the Services are the entire agreement between us, the whole enchilada._

These Terms (and any additional terms, contracts, rules, and conditions that Company may post on the Services) constitute the entire agreement between you and Company with respect to the Services and supersede any prior agreements, oral or written, between you and Company as to that subject matter.

3. ## Updating These Terms. 

_Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and check these Terms every now and then, you might miss it. If we do have to change these Terms, we will do our best to let you know, but you should come back occasionally to see if the jokes have changed!_

Except as otherwise specifically provided, we may modify these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion, in which case we will update the “Last Revised” date at the top of these Terms. If we make changes that are material, we will use reasonable efforts to attempt to notify you, such as by placing a prominent notice on the first page of the App. However, it is your sole responsibility to review these Terms from time to time to view any such changes. The updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services after the modifications have become effective will be deemed your acceptance of the modified Terms. 

4. ## Termination of License and your Account. 

_We hope you are a long-time user and enjoyer of our App. However, your agreement to these Terms is important to us. In this section, you agree that if you violate any of these Terms, we may have to change your access to the App and, in some circumstances, terminate your account entirely._

If you breach any of the provisions of these Terms, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, all licenses granted by the Company will terminate automatically. Additionally, the Company may suspend, disable, or delete any utility, privileges, or benefits to which you might otherwise be entitled, your Account, and/or the Services (or any part of the foregoing) with or without notice, for any or no reason, in the Company’s sole discretion. If the Company deletes your Account for any suspected breach of these Terms by you, you are prohibited from re-registering for the Services under a different name, email, or phone number. In the event of Account deletion for any reason, the Company may, but is not obligated to, delete any of Your Content. The Company shall not be responsible for the failure to delete or deletion of Your Content. 

5. ## Injunctive Relief. 

_Sticks and stones may break our bones…but if you break any of these Terms, there could be serious repercussions (aside from hurting our feelings). Repercussions that money can’t make right. A hug won’t do it either._

You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to the Company for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security or proof of damages.

6. ## California Residents. 

_California resident? So are we! (By way of Delaware as our state of incorporation) You have special means of complaining about us. Take that, New Jersey!_

You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services, and/or other information or materials provided by the Company hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval.

11. ## Miscellaneous. 

_This is the equivalent of the mixed nuts bowl at a bar - a mix of stuff that shouldn’t make sense but somehow works together. Plus, both make you thirsty for beer._

If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
